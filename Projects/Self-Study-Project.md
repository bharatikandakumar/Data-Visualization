# 1. Data Visualization

Data visualization is a powerful tool to communicate when done right. It delivers information with both the weight of respected research, and the cut-through clarity of good design. But, unfortunately, there are visualizations that are incomprehensible or meaningless.

# 2. What makes a visualization good?

We visualize data to enable looking at data differently and to understand it. A data visualization can be good only if it engages the audience but also increase the depth of understanding. To achieve a good data visualization, we need the following things.

## 2.1. Data Analysis
Unprocessed data is just numbers. But with proper analysis, it can help discover many new insights. Ideally data analysis is done to find two things

* Patterns
* Relationships

### 2.1.1. Patterns

* It is human nature to see patterns in the world around us like stock market pattern, or weather. We do that to predict what can possibly happen in the future.
* A good analysis looks for patterns across time, space and between different categories. Exploring the data in this way allows significant patterns to emerge – these patterns tell a story about how the world works or is changing.

### 2.1.2. Relationships
* A ‘relationship’ in data is most often a correlation, in other words, does something go up as another thing goes down?
* It isn’t until we explore data that we discover what it can tell us.   From there, we need to interpret the story for others.

## 2.2. Storytelling with data

### 2.2.1. Communication
Data visualization should communicate something to an audience, whether that’s a point of view, a case for change, or simply new information.
### 2.2.2. Audience Familiarity
To be meaningful to your audience, this information needs to be considered from their point of view.  The terms you use, and concepts you refer to should be familiar to your audience.  An audience of executives will require different information than a general audience.  

> A good data visualization tells a story to the audience, using language and ideas that they understand.

## 2.3. Design
When we analyze data, we glean our insights, so there’s no need to explain the significance of the data to ourselves.  But for our audience, you must provide a clear and simple explanation of what the data is about, and that’s where good design comes in.

Good data visualization design ensures that everyone who sees it understands what it represents.  To that end, good visualizations involve best practice design elements:

### 2.3.1. Visual Clues
Great books use words to describe characters, scenes and action.  Similarly, great design uses visual clues to paint a picture about the data.
Symbols such as the dollar sign, skull and cross-bones and love hearts are all examples of strong visual cues.  Abstract shapes and colors can also be used to indicate qualities such as heat, volume and distance.

### 2.3.2. Visual Hierarchy
Our eyes tend to search for things which stand out.  Good design uses this to its advantage to ensure the most important information is read first.
Using larger and smaller sizes is one simple way to establish a visual hierarchy, as is applying bold colors to key data while lightening or softening other elements.

### 2.3.3. Negative Space
Clutter is the enemy of readability.

### 2.3.4. Annotation
Annotation can help to contextualize the visualization.  It can tell the audience where and when the data is from, who collected it and how.  This kind of context can both help the audience understand the data and establish its credibility.
## 2.4. Avoid bad data visualization
The following are the five common mistakes that lead to bad data visualization

### 2.4.1. Bad Data
Start with the basics: is your data clean? Use checks at every stage the data goes through collection, sourcing, cleaning, and compiling before it is visualized. Common errors include data duplication, missed data, NA values not marked, and so on.

### 2.4.2. Wrong Choice of Data Visualization
Once our data is ready, we should be careful about what type of visualization we use.

### 2.4.3. Misrepresentation of Data
The biggest crime in data visualization is leading the viewer to a wrong interpretation. The data visualizations we create should be built in a way that it is interpreted right by the viewers.

### 2.4.4. Too Much Color or Information
While it has been established that using different colors help people interpret data visualizations quicker, too much color can confuse the viewer.

### 2.4.5. Inconsistent Scales
We can represent multiple variables in a single data visualization. However, it is always a good practice to represent them on a single scale to avoid confusion.

# 3. Evaluating Data Visualizations

Now, let us evaluate a few data visualizations according to the framework defined above.

## 3.1. Data Visualization 1

The following chart is from the UN climate change conference to agree on the steps needed to restrict global warming to about two degrees Celsius by the end of the century, and so reduce the risk of drought and floods. Its member states were divided into four major factions: the influential states, the obstructers, the successful and the weak states. The visualization conveys the Co2 emission rate, GDP value and population of different states on hovering upon the elements.

**Conclusion**

The visualization looks cluttered to understand which states are represented. Hovering to each element to understand is very tedious. It would have been better if done in a world map template. Also, the tags (the weak, the successful, the obstructers, the influential) are not clear and could be easily misinterpreted.

## 3.2. Data Visualization 2
The following is the stake of the UN climate change conference.  An effort to cut down on emissions to reduce the global mean temperature has been committed by different states and if that target is met, what could be the climate change in the future years is calculated and represented in the visualization.

**Conclusion**

The visualization is very understandable, and the global mean temperature change by 2100 is predicted and conveyed correctly. I personally do not see an area for misinterpretation in this visualization. The effect based on the emission cut down target met for a span of every 10 years is predicted and presented clearly. Overall, I think this visualization conveys the information that it was intended to.

## 3.3. Data Visualization 3
The following visualization is a relation between fast growing cities and increasing climate risks. Almost all (95%) of cities facing extreme climate risks are in Africa or Asia according to a [report](https://www.maplecroft.com/insights/analysis/84-of-worlds-fastest-growing-cities-face-extreme-climate-change-risks/) by risk analysts.  And it's the faster-growing cities that are most at risk, including megacities like Lagos in Nigeria and Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Some 84 of the world's 100 fastest-growing cities face "extreme" risks from rising temperatures and extreme weather brought on by climate change.[Source](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-46384067)

**Conclusion**

The visualization does convey that with higher growth in population has more climate risk. But the y-axis which is growth in population is not clear. Also, the heading says growth 2018 – 2035. But these years are not represented anywhere in the visualization. It also looks cluttered. It says that the circle size represents current population. If that is the case, where is the population growth prediction mentioned in the title. Though this visualization conveys the bigger picture that more the population, more vulnerable the country is for climate risks, it needs a lot of improvement to make the viewers understand details.

## 3.4. Data Visualization 4

**Conclusion**
This set of visualizations – first conveying the change in the climate and then comparing that pattern with different factors convey the story precisely. The representation is also very easily understandable. And we can conclude that it is the greenhouse gases causing the change by just looking at the visualization. So, I think this visualization is analyzed and designed well at the same time conveying the story on point.

**Conclusion**

The study here aims to convey that the while making the climate more variable, volcanic eruptions have little influence on the long-term temperature trend. But the visualization does the opposite. **It argues against that climate change is caused by human activity.** There is no representation on the chart as to what does the red and blue lines represent respectively. The volcano images are represented in red, so a viewer might assume that the red line represents the climate change during volcanic eruptions which is a directly opposite to the story they are trying to convey.

Though displayed in other formats such as<br>maps, the content is much similar to today’s visualizations, which mostly<br> presented geologic, economic, and medical data. The earliest seeds of<br> visualization arose in geometric diagrams, in tables of the positions of<br> stars and other celestial bodies, and in the making of maps to aid in<br> navigation and exploration. |

This century also saw<br> considerable new growth in theory as well as the dawn of practical application.                                                                                                                                                       |
| 1700-1799          | New Graphic   Forms                                  | With some rudiments of statistical theory, data of interest and importance,<br> and the idea of graphic representation somewhat established the<br>   18th century witnessed the expansion of these aspects to new domains and new   graphic forms. |
| 1800-1850          | Beginnings of   Modern Graphics                      | With the   foundation provided by the previous innovations of design and<br> technique, the first half of the 19th century witnessed explosive growth<br> in statistical   graphics and thematic mapping at a rate which would not equal<br> until modern   times. |
