# Making of the visualizations for Speed Violations in Chicago

I started with working on the visualizations created during data exploration phase of the project. One major insight which was observed is that the number of speed violations continued to decrease over the years.

As it is a major insight to argue that we should continue the automated speed enforcement program, I retained that visualization and represented a forecast of how the trend could be in the following year.

> Insight
The number of violations continues to decrease over the years. We can notice that the forecast is that the speed violations will continue to decrease.
